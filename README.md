Wassup is a real-time web chat application built with Django for educational purposes. The project aims to provide a straightforward platform for small- and medium-sized groups to communicate without unnecessary add-ons. After logging in, users access a dashboard that lists rooms in three categories: rooms they own, rooms in which they are guests, and public rooms that can be joined at any time. Within any room, participants can exchange text or photo messages in real time, and the full conversation history remains available at all times. Room owners can edit settings, hand ownership to another member, or delete the room. Participants may edit settings if owner allows it, leave room or mark it as a favourite for quick access. These live interactions are delivered over WebSocket connections managed by Django Channels, so updates reach every client immediately without page reloads and with minimal network overhead.
